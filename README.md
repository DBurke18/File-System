# File-System
The creation and extension of a user-space device driver for a filesystem that is built on top of a virtual disk drive. The multiple operations perform in this practice is the same as the normal UNIX I/O operations, with the caveat that they direct file operations to the FS3 device instead of the host filesystem.
